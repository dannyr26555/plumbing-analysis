# Analysis Accuracy Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to enhance the accuracy of PDF plumbing analysis and reduce hallucination issues.

## Problem Analysis

The original system showed issues with:
- **AI over-interpretation**: Providing specific quantities when not clearly determinable from documents
- **Poor PDF text extraction**: Difficulty with scanned or image-based PDFs
- **Scale misinterpretation**: Incorrect length measurements without proper scale detection
- **Low image quality**: Processing at 768x768 resolution reduced detail clarity

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging
- **Change**: Enabled DEBUG level logging in `pdf_converter.py`
- **Benefit**: Better visibility into text extraction quality and PDF processing issues
- **Usage**: Check logs for warnings about image-based PDFs or poor text extraction

### 2. Increased Image Quality
- **Change**: Raised image resolution limit from 768x768 to 1536x1536 pixels
- **Benefit**: Better detail preservation for complex construction drawings
- **Impact**: Improved AI ability to distinguish symbols and read annotations

### 3. Material Quantity Validation
- **New Functions**: `validate_material_quantities()` and `filter_low_confidence_materials()`
- **Features**:
  - Flags quantities over 10,000 units for review
  - Detects overly precise measurements that may be estimates
  - Reduces confidence scores for suspicious quantities
  - Adds notes explaining validation concerns

### 4. Confidence-Based Filtering
- **Multi-stage filtering**:
  - Initial filter: Removes materials with confidence < 0.4 during extraction
  - Final filter: Removes materials with confidence < 0.6 before output
- **Benefit**: Eliminates low-confidence hallucinations while preserving reasonable estimates

### 5. Per-Page Deduplication Enhancement
- **Approach**: Deduplication happens within each page during extraction
- **Benefit**: Eliminates duplicate materials found multiple times on the same page
- **Method**: Materials from different pages remain separate (no cross-page combining)
- **Result**: Clean material lists per page with accurate page-specific quantities

### 6. Conservative AI Prompts
- **Enhanced prompts** with explicit guidance:
  - Only provide quantities when clearly visible in annotations
  - Use lower confidence scores for uncertain measurements
  - Prefer null values over guessed quantities
  - Avoid estimating pipe lengths without clear scale markings
  - Limit quantities to reasonable ranges (< 1000 without documentation)

### 6. Debug API Endpoints
New endpoints for analysis troubleshooting:

#### `/api/debug/text-extraction/{task_id}`
- Shows raw text extraction results
- Legend detection statistics
- Text block counts and samples

#### `/api/debug/intermediate/{task_id}`
- All intermediate analysis results by agent
- Preprocessor classifications
- Context extraction data
- Plumbing analysis outputs

#### `/api/debug/material-validation/{task_id}`
- Filtering statistics
- Confidence score distribution
- Validation process details

## Usage Instructions

### Running Analysis with Improvements
1. Start the backend server: `python main.py`
2. Upload and analyze PDFs as normal
3. Check debug endpoints for detailed insights

### Testing the Improvements
Use the provided test script:
```bash
python test_improvements.py path/to/your/pdf/file.pdf
```

This will:
- Upload and analyze the PDF
- Show filtering statistics
- Display confidence distributions
- Provide debug information
- Sample the final materials list

### Interpreting Results

#### Good Indicators:
- Average confidence > 0.7
- Low number of flagged quantities
- Reasonable material counts
- Clear text extraction with multiple legend entries

#### Warning Signs:
- Many materials filtered out (>50% reduction)
- Very low average confidence (<0.5)
- No text extraction (image-based PDF)
- Large quantities without documentation

## Configuration Options

### Confidence Thresholds
- Early filtering: 0.4 (in `main.py`, line ~910)
- Final filtering: 0.6 (in `main.py`, line ~953)
- Adjust based on your accuracy requirements

### Quantity Validation
- Max reasonable quantity: 10,000 (in `validate_material_quantities()`)
- Precision threshold: >1 decimal place for quantities >100
- Modify limits based on typical project sizes

### Image Quality
- Current limit: 1536x1536 pixels
- Increase for very detailed drawings (may impact performance)
- Decrease for faster processing of simple drawings

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks
1. Monitor filtering rates - high filtering may indicate PDF quality issues
2. Review flagged materials for recurring patterns
3. Check confidence distributions across different PDF types
4. Validate critical quantities manually

### Troubleshooting
- **High filtering rates**: Check PDF quality, consider OCR preprocessing
- **Low confidence scores**: Review AI prompts, consider retraining
- **Missing materials**: Check text extraction debug, verify legend detection
- **Incorrect quantities**: Review validation rules, adjust thresholds

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
1. **OCR integration** for scanned PDFs
2. **Scale detection** from drawing annotations
3. **Material type classification** for better validation rules
4. **Learning from corrections** to improve confidence scoring
5. **Multi-model consensus** for critical extractions
