1. For the Materials and Quantities section, use a table format:
   | Material | Quantity | Unit |
   |----------|----------|------|
   | 8" PVC, C-900, DR-14 Purple Recycled Water Main | 181 | LF |
   | 8"-45° Compact D.I. Elbow | 9 | EA |

2. For other sections, use clear headings and bullet points
3. Start the content on a new line after each heading
4. Use a blank line between sections

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT guess, speculate, or invent information. If something is unclear or absent, say so explicitly.
- Be concise but thorough.
- For materials, remove words like "Install", "Construct", etc. from the material descriptions.
- Use standard units: EA (each), LF (linear feet), SF (square feet), etc.
